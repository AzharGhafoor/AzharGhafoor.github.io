#### Students learn
<p align="justify">In the "Secure Software Development" course, students will gain a thorough understanding of fundamental principles and practices in secure software engineering. The curriculum begins with an exploration of secure software development cycles, distinguishing them from regular cycles, and delves into the causes of vulnerabilities, covering faults, problems, threats, and various attack vectors. Frameworks like NIST, CRET, and OWASP are introduced, shedding light on vulnerability concepts at different levels. Students then progress to models for secure software elicitation, system design using UML, misuse cases, and features of vulnerabilities. Threat modeling, attacker modeling, and frameworks such as OWASP, NIST, and CERT are covered extensively, providing insights at the implementation level. Vulnerability assessment and management, including topics like string format, overflow, and DevOps security, are explored in depth. The course also emphasizes the vital role of software testing for system quality and addresses software project risk management and assessment.</p>
