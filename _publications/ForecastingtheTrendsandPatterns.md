abstract: "The Crime Prediction Method is a systemic approach to preventing the detection and review of past crime data patterns and trends and uses it for future crime forecasting. This system is designed to predict the type of crime in a given region that is highly likely to occur and can view areas susceptible to crime. Crime analyzers are helping law enforcement officers to solve crimes with the growing advent of computerized systems. Using machine learning methods, we can derive information from past crime data that is unknown and useful before and can predict future crimes. Here we are working to build a machine learning procedure between computer science and criminal justice, so that crimes can be resolved faster. Instead of focusing on the causes of crime, such as crime, political hostility, etc., we concentrate mostly on the crime factors of every day."
