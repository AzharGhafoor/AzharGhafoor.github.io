  <h4>Why help ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦</h4>
  I was in Ukraine on the day of invasion. On the 24th, I managed to evacuate my mother to Poland. But, my grandmother is very close to the line of contact now. She was a rocket engineer working on the Soviet Concorde, Tu-144. And her father, my grand-grand father lost his arm defending russians against hitler. She raised me and I love her very much. And now she is not so well and living (surviving) in the basement. This war is very personal to me. I am crying inside and outside, as I am here and my friends are fighting and dying on the streets of my town.

  Together with my friends we are raising money to give direct support to civilians who are now risking their lives to protect not on Ukraine, but all freedom of the whole civilised world. It all started with us searching for components of bulletproof vests that are assembled by volunteers in Kharkiv.

  We have already provided firefighters of Kharkiv with such essential equipment as gloves and cloths. And after hours of searching, I finally found a pair of size 49 army boots for a brave volunteer, who is now protecting my beautiful, yet half-destroyed, town of Chernihiv.

  <h4>Plates for bulletproof vests</h4>
   We are searching for level III protection plates for bulletproof vests ([example](https://uarmprotection.com/product/sa3u-level-iii-uhmwpe)). If you know where we could order them, or are able to donate a few, please contact me at [pavlo.bazilinskyy@gmail.com](mailto:pavlo.bazilinskyy@gmail.com).

  <h4>Drones</h4>
  My friends in the territorial defence forces are really desperate for drones for surveillance (and not armoured action). If you, or you contacts have a drone or two that you do not need any more, please contact me at [pavlo.bazilinskyy@gmail.com](mailto:pavlo.bazilinskyy@gmail.com).

  <h4>Sleeping bags</h4>
  Hundreds of innocent civilians are now homeless. They are sleeping on bare soil/concrete floor of a basement in freezing temperatures. Maybe you can donate your old sleeping bag or are in contact with an organisation that could spare some (scouting, campsite, sports society etc.), please contact me at [pavlo.bazilinskyy@gmail.com](mailto:pavlo.bazilinskyy@gmail.com).

  <h4>How to donate</h4>
  Thank you very much for your support and solidarity with Ukraine. We are standing strong in Ukraine, but every day we are losing Ukrainians to this horrific war. Believe me, we all want the russian aggression to <sdtrong>STOP</sdtrong>. That's why every Ukrainian is doing everything possible to support Ukraine in this difficult situation. And I know for a fact that you can help us stop it!  

  We have now raised more than â‚¬13000 and have shipped 11 boxes of donations from Poland to Ukraine. We are hoping to buy more assembled bulletproof vests, helmets, and drones. And we need your help! If you donate even 1 dollar or 1 euro, it will help us get closer to the end of this brutal war. Please help us make a difference. You may contribute in various ways:
