abstract: "In the healthcare industry, we cannot deny, contradict, or oppose the importance of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The ultimate purpose of the IoMT system is to gather and transmit health information, including ECG readings, weight measurements, blood pressure data, and sugar levels. This data may be shared with authorized individuals, such as physicians, participating health companies, insurance providers, or external contractors, regardless of their time, location, or device. However, the situation is not as straightforward because IoMT faces various emerging cyberattacks and threats. New malware attacks targeting IoMT are created and launched daily because attackers recognize the immense value of this market, worth billions. The purpose of this paper is to introduce you to some of the well-known attacks targeting IoT, including denial of service, router attacks, sensor attacks, replay attacks, fingerprinting, time-based spoofing, and recent malware attacks like Miari, Emoted, Gamut, and NE curs, as well as ransomware in IoMT."
