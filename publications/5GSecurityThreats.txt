   abstract = {The 5G (fifth generation) network will provide a wide range of connectivity to share information and data with a low latency rate, higher bandwidth and more frequency spectrum to increase speed. Massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices&apos; security is critical to secure communication between different devices. 5G wireless communication offers new services and frameworks, but it is also amplifying security impacts. However, there are a lot of challenges to users&apos; privacy as well. This report provides an overall view of threats and challenges in 5G networks and presents solutions to these challenges. In addition, 5G is being used to increase communication security while providing essential building blocks for physical layer security.},
