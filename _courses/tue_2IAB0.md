#### Introduction
<p align="justify">The course on "Secure Software Development" is meticulously crafted to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in developing software with a strong emphasis on security. In an era marked by increasing cyber threats and vulnerabilities, this course equips participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to create robust, secure software applications. The curriculum delves into foundational concepts of secure coding practices, encryption methodologies, and threat modeling. Participants will gain insights into identifying and mitigating common vulnerabilities, understanding the principles of secure design, and implementing security best practices throughout the software development lifecycle.</p>
<p align="justify">The course adopts a hands-on approach, allowing participants to apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios. Through real-world case studies, participants will analyze security breaches, dissect the root causes, and implement preventive measures. Additionally, the course covers the integration of security testing into the development process, ensuring that participants are adept at identifying and rectifying security flaws during the various stages of software development. The importance of adhering to industry standards and compliance regulations is also emphasized, providing participants with a holistic perspective on secure software development practices.</p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, the course addresses emerging trends and challenges in the cybersecurity landscape, preparing participants to stay ahead of evolving threats. It fosters a collaborative learning environment where participants can engage in discussions, share insights, and work on practical exercises. Whether participants are seasoned developers looking to enhance their security acumen or individuals new to the field, this course aims to empower them with the skills and knowledge needed to contribute to the creation of resilient and secure software systems. Overall, "Secure Software Development" serves as a crucial foundation for professionals seeking to navigate the complex intersection of software development and cybersecurity.</p>

#### My role
- 2022–: Instructor.

#### Course Learning Objectives
<p align="justify">The Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) for "Secure Software Development" encapsulate the essential competencies students will gain. These include the ability to critically evaluate threats and vulnerabilities, apply security principles, model system artifacts with a focus on threat aspects, apply analysis and testing skills for vulnerability mitigation, and explore new dimensions in secure software development. The CLOs collectively emphasize the course's commitment to providing students with a comprehensive understanding of secure software development practices.</p>



- **Objective 1**. Critically evaluate threats and vulnerabilities, applying essential security principles.
- **Objective 2**. Model system artifacts with consideration for threat and vulnerability aspects.
- **Objective 3**. Apply analysis and testing skills, focusing on vulnerability and threat perspectives, and implement mechanisms for mitigation. 
- **Objective 4**. Explore new avenues in secure software development, understanding both strengths and limitations.

#### Students learn
- To use basic statistical concepts and techniques (like the mean, median, mode, percentile, range, variance, confidence intervals, p-value, correlation, and t-test).
- To read database schemes and write simple queries to a data base in SQL.
- To clean data (missing values, duplicates, and outlier detection).
- To choose and apply data transformations (normalization, aggregation), data reduction, and data discretion. 
- To choose and apply suitable visualization techniques (like line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, box plots, violin plots, and heat maps).
- To analyse and model data (linear regression, clustering, decision tree mining, association rules learning).
- To choose and communicate interesting findings in the language understandable for their end user (visually or textually). 
- To use tools for implementing data engineering tasks (Excel in week 1, and Python with Jupiter Notebooks during the rest of the course). 
- To implement their solutions in Python using a structured approach to programming. 
- Students will also learn to estimate the consequences of choices made for the other phases of data processing. The interpretation of results is considered in every phase of the analysis.

#### Course setup
- One lecture of two hours per week during 7 weeks. 
- Online homework, including self-study based on screencasts and tutorials and exercises in OnCourse (part of graded homework). 
- Two practicum sessions of two hours per week during 7 weeks. 

#### Grading
- Written exam – 50% of the final grade.
- Two graded assignments – 20% of the final grade per assignment. Students work on realistic data analytics problems.
- Online exercises – 10% of the final grade.
