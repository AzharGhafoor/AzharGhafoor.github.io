  abstract: "In the healthcare industry, we cannot deny, contradict, or oppose the importance of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The ultimate purpose of the IoMT system is to gather and transmit health information, including ECG readings, weight measurements, blood pressure data, and sugar levels. This data may be shared with authorized individuals, such as physicians, participating health companies, insurance providers, or external contractors, regardless of their time, location, or device. However, the situation is not as straightforward because IoMT faces various emerging cyberattacks and threats. New malware attacks targeting IoMT are created and launched daily because attackers recognize the immense value of this market, worth billions. The purpose of this paper is to introduce you to some of the well-known attacks targeting IoT, including denial of service, router attacks, sensor attacks, replay attacks, fingerprinting, time-based spoofing, and recent malware attacks like Miari, Emoted, Gamut, and NE curs, as well as ransomware in IoMT."

  abstract: "The Crime Prediction Method is a systemic approach to preventing the detection and review of past crime data patterns and trends and uses it for future crime forecasting. This system is designed to predict the type of crime in a given region that is highly likely to occur and can view areas susceptible to crime. Crime analyzers are helping law enforcement officers to solve crimes with the growing advent of computerized systems. Using machine learning methods, we can derive information from past crime data that is unknown and useful before and can predict future crimes. Here we are working to build a machine learning procedure between computer science and criminal justice, so that crimes can be resolved faster. Instead of focusing on the causes of crime, such as crime, political hostility, etc., we concentrate mostly on the crime factors of every day."

#   abstract: "This project set out to investigate the benefits of using private heaps for memory management and static thread placement for optimising performance and cache usage. For this study, Insense, which is a component-based programming language developed in the University of St Andrews that abstracts over complications of memory management, concurrency control and synchronisation, was used (Dearle et al. 2008). Two memory management schemes are under investigation: use of a single shared heap and use of multiple private heaps. Further, three thread placement schemes are designed and implemented: 1) even distribution among cores; 2) placing all components on a single core; 3) locating Insense components based on frequency of inter-component communication. Furthermore, several elements of this investigation are worth emphasizing. With regard to allocation and deallocation of memory taking place in component instances running on different cores, the efficiency of using a private heap for each component resulted in speedup by a factor of 16. Then, utilising private heaps reduces a number of L1 cache misses by ~30%. Distributing components over cores according to communication pattern, for the most part performed similar to allowing the OS to perform thread placement dynamically according to load balance. In cases where no exchange of data between components takes place, static placement outperformed because there is no computation which may make load balancing dynamic placement of threads under control of the OS difficult. In this case, the static placement scheme was faster than dynamic balancing by a factor of 2.4."

#   abstract: "This thesis answers the question whether a scheduler needs to take into account where communicating threads in multi-threaded applications are executed. The impact of cache on data-sharing in multi-threaded environments is measured. This work investigates a common base–case scenario in the telecommunication industry, where a programme has one thread that writes data and one thread that reads data. A taxonomy of inter-thread communication is defined. Furthermore, a mathematical model that describes inter-thread communication is presented. Two cycle–level experiments were designed to measure latency of CPU registers, cache and main memory. These results were utilised to quantify the model. Three application–level experiments were used to verify the model by comparing predictions of the model and data received in the real-life setting. The model broadens the applicability of experimental results, and it describes three types of communication outlined in the taxonomy. Storing communicating data across all levels of cache does have an impact on the speed of data–intense multi-threaded applications. Scheduling threads in a sender–receiver scenario to different dies in a multi-chip processor decreases speed of execution of such programmes by up to 37%. Pinning such threads to different cores in the same chip results in up to 5% decrease in speed of execution. The findings of this study show how threads need to be scheduled by a cache-aware scheduler. This project extends the author’s previous work, which investigated cache interference."

#   abstract: "This study investigated peoples’ opinion on auditory interfaces in contemporary cars and their willingness to be exposed to auditory feedback in automated driving. We used an Internet-based survey to collect 1,205 responses from 91 countries. The respondents stated their attitudes towards two existing auditory driver assistance systems, a parking assistant (PA) and a forward collision warning system (FCWS), as well as towards a futuristic augmented sound system (FS) proposed for fully automated driving. The respondents were positive towards the PA and FCWS, and rated the willingness to have automated versions of these systems as 3.87 and 3.77, respectively (on a scale from 1 = disagree strongly to 5 = agree strongly). The respondents tolerated the FS (the mean willingness to use it was 3.00 on the same scale). The results showed that among the available response options, the female voice was the most preferred feedback type for takeover requests in highly automated driving, regardless of whether the respondents’ country was English speaking or not. The present results could be useful for designers of automated vehicles and other stakeholders."

#   abstract: "Fully automated driving can potentially provide enormous benefits to society. However, it has been unclear whether people will appreciate such far-reaching technology. This study investigated anonymous textual comments regarding fully automated driving, based on data extracted from three online surveys with 8,862 respondents from 112 countries. Initial filtering of comments with fewer than 15 characters resulted in 1,952 comments. The sample consisted primarily of males (74%) and had a mean age of 32.6 years. Next, we launched a crowdsourcing job and asked 69 workers to assign each of the 1,952 comments to at least one of 12 predefined categories, which included positive and negative attitude to automated driving, enjoyment in manual driving, concerns about trust, reliability of software, and readiness of road infrastructure. 46% of the comments were classified into the category ‘no meaningful information about automated driving’, leaving 792 comments for further analysis. 39% of the comments were classified as ‘positive attitude towards automated driving’ and 23% were classified as ‘negative attitude towards automated driving’. In conclusion, the public opinion appears to be split, with a substantial number of respondents being positive and a significant number of respondents being negative towards fully automated driving."

#   abstract: "Driving is a safety-critical task that predominantly relies on vision. However, visual information from the environment is sometimes degraded or absent. In other cases, visual information is available, but the driver fails to use it due to distraction or impairment. Providing drivers with real-time auditory feedback about the state of the vehicle in relation to the environment may be an appropriate means of support when visual information is compromised. In this study, we explored whether driving can be performed solely by means of artificial auditory feedback. We focused on lane keeping, a task that is vital for safe driving. Three auditory parameter sets were tested: (1) predictor time, where the volume of a continuous tone was a linear function of the predicted lateral error from the lane centre 0 s, 1 s, 2 s, or 3 s into the future; (2) feedback mode (volume feedback vs. beep-frequency feedback) and mapping (linear vs. exponential relationship between predicted error and volume/beep frequency); and (3) corner support, in which in addition to volume feedback, a beep was offered upon entering/leaving a corner, or alternatively when crossing the lane centre while driving in a corner. A dead-zone was used, whereby the volume/beep-frequency feedback was provided only when the vehicle deviated more than 0.5 m from the centre of the lane. An experiment was conducted in which participants (N = 2) steered along a track with sharp 90-degree corners in a simulator with the visual projection shut down. Results showed that without predictor feedback (i.e., 0 s prediction), participants were more likely to depart the road compared to with predictor feedback. Moreover, volume feedback resulted in fewer road departures than beep-frequency feedback. The results of this study may be used in the design of in-vehicle auditory displays. Specifically, we recommend that feedback be based on anticipated error rather than current error."

#   abstract: "Previous research showed that perceived risk is an important psychological determinant governing road user behaviour. However, little knowledge exists about how objective in-scene features affect a driver’s perceived risk in interactions with pedestrians. This crowdsourcing study tries to fill this research gap. A total of 1082 participants watched 35 out of a total of 86 dashcam videos featuring interactions with pedestrians extracted from the Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE) dataset. The videos contained annotations of pedestrian eye contact, crossing behaviour, GPS location, vehicle speed, and yielding rules. The distance between vehicle and pedestrian was manually added, and object counts (detected number of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles) and respective sizes were added as an index of visual clutter. In each video, participants were asked to press a key on their keyboard and hold it as long as they felt a situation could become risky, and after each video rate perceived risk using a slider and answer whether the pedestrian had made eye contact. Videos in which the participant observed eye contact, increased perceived risk, suggesting that eye contact increases drivers’ vigilance. Videos with more visual clutter, and with higher vehicle speed were also associated with increased perceived risk. However, the causality of the correlation with vehicle speed can be questioned and may be mediated by the environment and whether crossing occurred. Videos in which yielding rules were absent, compared to videos in which they were present, did not affect perceived risk. This study is the first to investigate how pedestrians’ eye contact affects drivers’ perceived risk. The presented results could be useful in safe road design or be used as input for eHMI activation to enhance safety."

#   abstract: "Lane change decision-making is an important challenge for automated vehicles, urging the need for high performance algorithms that are able to handle complex traffic situations. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a machine learning method based on artificial neural networks, has recently become a popular choice for modelling the lane change decision-making process, outperforming various traditional rule-based models. So far, performance has often been expressed in terms of achieved average speed, absence of collisions or merging success rate. However, no studies have investigated how humans will react to the resulting behavior as potential occupants. This study addresses this research gap by validating a self-developed DRL-based lane changing model (trained using proximal policy optimization) from a technology acceptance perspective through an online crowdsourcing experiment. Participants (N = 1085) viewed a random subset of 32 out of 120 videos of an automated vehicle driving on a three-lane highway with varying traffic densities featuring our proposed model or a baseline policy (i.e. a state-of-the-art rule-based model, MOBIL). They were tasked to press a response key if the decision-making was deemed undesirable and subsequently rated the vehicle’s behavior along four acceptance constructs (performance expectancy, safety, human-likeness and reliability) on a scale of 1 to 5. Results showed that the proposed model caused a significantly lower amount of disagreements and was rated significantly higher on all four acceptance constructs compared to the baseline policy. Moreover, considerable differences between individual disagreement rates were observed for both models. Our findings offer prospects for the practical application of DRL-based lane change models in a use-case scenario, depending on the user. Further research is necessary to examine whether these observations hold in other (more complex) traffic situations. Additionally, we recommend combining DRL with other modelling techniques that allow for personalization of behavioral parameters, such as imitation learning."
