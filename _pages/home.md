Welcome to my cybersecurity journey, where my passion meets practical research, a profound fondness for cybersecurity skills, and a commitment to learning and training others. I'm [Azhar Ghafoor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azhar-ghafoor/), a Cybersecurity Analyst, and I'm here to share my story.

In my role as a Cybersecurity Analyst at [Cytomate Solutions & Services](https://cytomate.net/), I've been instrumental in shaping the digital landscape. Over the past 1 year and 3 months, I've pioneered cutting-edge compliance tools, led post-attack assessment systems, and championed attack surface management and [Sarab](https://cytomate.net/project/sarab). My journey extends beyond these achievements; I'm deeply immersed in machine learning-driven log analysis, advanced cyber deception systems, and impactful phishing awareness campaigns. I've seamlessly integrated network protection technologies with [SIEM solutions](https://wazuh.com/), resulting in significant reductions in successful attacks. My collaborative approach has honed my communication and teamwork skills.

As a Cybersecurity Researcher at [Cybersecurity Lab](https://comsats.edu.pk/) for the past 2 years and 9 months, I've embarked on a quest to divert malicious entities from organizational assets. Profiling threat actors and developing sophisticated [models using machine learning](https://gist.github.com/AzharGhafoor/cc149986fd8588e4c6ed31e9866d29a3) to classify web attacks have been my forte.

Knowledge-sharing is a cornerstone of my journey. As a [Cybersecurity Content Writer](https://ghafoorazhar.medium.com/) on [Medium](https://medium.com/), I regularly distill my expertise into insightful articles and tutorials. This commitment extends to my role as a [Professional Freelancer](https://www.fiverr.com/azharghafoor39?up_rollout=true) on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/azharghafoor39), where I consistently deliver exceptional results across various domains.

Educationally, my [Master's in Information Security](https://azharghafoor.netlify.app/) from [COMSATS University Islamabad](https://comsats.edu.pk/) has equipped me with a diverse skill set. From compliance management to malware analysis, I'm primed to tackle complex cybersecurity challenges.

My portfolio is a testament to my dedication, innovation, and passion for cybersecurity. As we connect, we embark on a shared journey to fortify digital defenses and empower individuals and organizations. Together, we shape a secure digital future.

### Empowering Users to Secure Their Online Presence

I am currently spearheading a vital [Open-Source Intelligence](https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-open-source-intelligence/) (OSINT) project aimed at revolutionizing data collection and bolstering online security. In this undertaking, I am solely responsible for developing a system that will empower users to search for records linked to their email addresses, usernames, or phone numbers, enabling them to identify potential compromises of their passwords and accounts, which may be exploited by attackers. This project holds paramount importance as it addresses the pressing need for enhanced online security in a world where personal information is a prime target for cybercriminals, ultimately equipping users with a pivotal tool to safeguard their digital identities and privacy. Stay tuned for updates on this groundbreaking system's journey to fortify online defenses.
