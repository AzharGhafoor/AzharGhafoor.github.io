#### Academia

 <p align="justify">I volunteered my time and expertise to educate junior students pursuing a [Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity](http://ww2.comsats.edu.pk/cs/BSCYS.aspx) at [COMSATS University Islamabad](https://comsats.edu.pk/) through hands-on labs. In these interactive sessions, I meticulously crafted comprehensive practical lab guides that encompassed a wide array of real-world scenarios essential for aspiring cybersecurity professionals. I had the privilege of presenting these guides as demos during their classes, offering students a deep dive into the intricate world of cybersecurity. The tutorials I developed covered an extensive range of topics, from the fundamentals of Linux to the utilization and customization of open-source tools, including the implementation of [firewalls](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-list-all-iptables-rules-in-linux/), [IDS, and IPS](https://www.snort.org/). We explored web attack detection and precautionary measures for real-world scenarios, dissected social engineering attacks, delved into PGP encryption, dissected the intricacies of DoS attacks, delved into ransomware creation, and even explored topics like ARP and DNS spoofing, among various other critical aspects of the cybersecurity field. These experiences aimed to equip students with the practical knowledge and skills they needed to embark on successful careers in cybersecurity.</p>

#### The Pinnacle of Support

 <p align="justify"> I took it upon myself to undertake a remarkable initiative aimed at supporting my fellow students in their journey towards successfully defending their [theses](http://library.comsats.edu.pk/Files/MS_Thesis_guidelines_hanbook.pdf). Recognizing the importance of this milestone, I organized comprehensive preparation sessions that were open to all. These sessions provided a platform for each student to present their work, enabling us to collectively identify any mistakes, issues, or areas in need of improvement. We worked collaboratively to guide them on how to address these weaknesses effectively. To foster confidence and facilitate practice, we encouraged every student to present their research to the group, mimicking the thesis defense scenario. This approach not only significantly bolstered their morale but also empowered them to anticipate potential questions and prepare well-thought-out responses. As a result, my fellow students gained invaluable experience, honed their [presentation skills](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/presentation-skills.html), and emerged well-prepared for their thesis defense with a profound sense of camaraderie and support. This endeavor stands as a testament to the dedication and teamwork that can flourish within a group of determined individuals committed to each other's success.</p>
