abstract: "Exterior vehicle sounds have been introduced in electric vehicles and as external human-machine interfaces for automated vehicles. While previous research has studied the effect of exterior vehicle sounds on detectability and acceptance, the present study takes on a different approach by examining the efficacy of such vehicle sounds in deterring people from crossing the road. An online study was conducted in which 226 participants were presented with different types of synthetic sounds, including sounds of a combustion engine, pure tones, combined tones, and beeps. A vehicle moving in a straight trajectory at a constant velocity of 30 km/h was used, and no visual information was provided. Participants in the role of pedestrians were asked to hold down a key when they felt safe to cross. After each trial, they assessed whether the vehicle sound was easy to notice, whether it gave enough information to realize that a vehicle was approaching, and whether the sound was annoying. The results showed that sounds of higher modeled perceived loudness, such as continuous tones with high frequency, were the most effective in deterring participants from crossing the road. The tested intermittent beeps proved to be relatively ineffective, presumably because no valuable information could be derived during the inter-pulse intervals. Tire noise proved to be relatively effective in deterring participants from crossing, and was found to be the least annoying. These results may prove insightful for the improvement of synthetic exterior vehicle sounds."
