abstract: "Phishing remains a critical security threat, involving the creation of fraudulent websites to capture sensitive information. Despite existing detection systems, sophisticated attackers have developed advanced evasion techniques that undermine these defenses. This paper highlights the significant challenge of these novel methods, focusing on how attackers manage to prolong the operational lifespan of phishing sites. Our research investigates how attackers circumvent traditional security layers by employing a combination of target filtering mechanisms, bot detection evasion, blacklisting avoidance, and honeypots. Our experimental findings indicate that these evasion strategies can achieve an effectiveness rate of 80% to 85% in extending the viability of phishing sites. We have empirically demonstrated the exposure of current systems to these attacks, revealing specific vulnerabilities and exploitation points. These results underscore the urgent need for enhanced detection frameworks that address the layered and adaptive nature of modern phishing tactics. Our work highlights a critical gap in current security measures and poses a challenge to solution providers: there is a pressing need for novel mitigations to safeguard users against these sophisticated phishing threats."
