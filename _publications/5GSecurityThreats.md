abstract: "The fifth-generation (5G) network is set to provide extensive connectivity for sharing information and data with low latency rates, increased bandwidth, and a broader frequency spectrum, ultimately boosting speed. Securing Massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices is paramount to ensure secure communication among various devices. While 5G wireless communication introduces new services and frameworks, it also magnifies security concerns. Additionally, it poses significant challenges to user privacy. This report offers a comprehensive overview of the threats and challenges inherent in 5G networks and presents potential solutions. Furthermore, 5G is leveraged to enhance communication security and provide essential building blocks for physical layer security."
