abstract: "Synthetic vehicle sounds have been introduced in electric vehicles and as external human-machine interfaces for automated vehicles. While previous research has mostly studied the effect of synthetic vehicle sounds on detectability and acceptance, the present study takes a different approach by examining the efficacy of synthetic vehicle sounds in refraining people from crossing the road. An online study was conducted in which 125 participants were presented with different types of synthetic sounds, including sounds of a combustion engine, pure tones, combined tones, and beeps. A straight vehicle trajectory with a constant velocity of 30 km/h was used, and no visual information was provided. Participants in the role of pedestrians were asked to hold a key as long as they felt safe to cross. Additionally, after each trial, participants were asked to assess whether the vehicle sound was easy to notice, whether it gave enough information to realize a vehicle was approaching, and whether the sound was annoying. The results showed that louder sounds were perceived as more annoying, but were also the most effective in preventing participants from crossing the road. This finding raises the question of how to design vehicle sounds that are noticeable and compelling, yet not too annoying."
